In last blog, I explained in detail about my experience and my point of view on Platform Engineering. 

([click here to read previous blog post on Platform Engineering through my lens](https://surajnarwade.com/blog/platform-engineering-through-my-lens/))

In this blog post, I would like to share a week in a life of a Platform Engineer as a personal experience as well as what I have heard from fellow Platform folks.

Take this with pinch of salt as we discussed in the previous blog, every organisation, their needs, their platform is unique & different.

Writing about A day won’t make sense :D

Regular event: standup which happens every day morning. now I am part of team which is geographically located in same timezone. 

but often teams are geopgraphically distributed, hence either they try to find common ground or they have async standup on slack or any other medium.

## Mondays

Every monday is Maintainance Mondays. On this day, we focus on reducing toil, tech debts by upgrading components of the infrastrctures.  upgrade depedendencies or libaries to clear up vulnerabilities.

This really help us keep on top. 

I usually have 1x1 with my Manager on Monday on fortnightly basis. 1x1 are such essential part for not just platform engineer but any working professionals to discuss career progressions, any issues or just chitchat sometimes :) 

Cadence for maintainance monday: some companies keep it weekly some keep it fortnightly. (I do it fortnightly)

Retro meeting again fortnightly. this meeting is an opportunity to gather as a team and discuss pain points, celebrate wins, burning questions and upcoming puzzling platform related stuff.

Tuesdays:

This is where I focus on work, there could be ad-hoc work as well.

Fortnightly, I also have planning meeting, this is where we go over the task board and discuss if there any blockers, does everyone in the team have enough work. 

Is there any urgent work which we need to prioritse depend on business needs.

Wednesday:

Middle of the week, focussing on work. we also tend to keep an eye on alerts in slack channel and if we notice any alerts are recurring then we investigate that service.

On this day, we have open door meeting where we invite our customers aka internal developers where we can showcase any upcoming things, developers can bring their queries to doubts.

they can also come up with any feature requests.

sometimes, it’s easy to discuss verbally than text chat in slack support channel.

Thursday:

Heading towards weekend, try to wrap up the work.

Friday: 

it’s friyay, usually this day will have either Tech all hands, or Show & Tell or Business All hands meeting.

Saturday & Sundays:

Usually nothing happens but if person is on-call for out of hours, then there could be incidents, false alerts, or Maintainances.

Along with this if I am the person on-call for in hours which means business hours then my work at hands take little backseat and I am focussed on providing support and assistant to developers.

they come to a slack channel and ask for help and I assist. I am also responsible for any incidents occured and I join the incident channel if they need any help regarding Platform related issues.

So overall that’s how week of platform engineer might look like, so how is your week looks like , Let me know in the comments??

## A Week in the Life of a Platform Engineer

In my last blog, I shared my experience and point of view on Platform Engineering. In this post, I want to share what a week in the life of a Platform Engineer can look like, based on my own experience and what I’ve heard from other platform folks too.

Take this with a pinch of salt. Every organisation is different. Their needs are different, and their platform is different too.

Also, writing about “a day” doesn’t make much sense for platform work. Some days are calm and planned. Some days are pure interruptions and support. So a week view feels more honest.

One regular thing across most teams is a daily standup. In my current setup, the team is in the same timezone, so standup is straightforward. In many organisations though, platform teams are geographically distributed. In that case, teams either find a common overlap window or do async standups using Slack or similar tools.

One more note before we get into the days: this is *my* cadence, but different teams do it differently. Some do maintenance weekly, some fortnightly. Some do planning weekly, some do it once every two weeks. The point is not the calendar, the point is protecting time for the right kind of work.

A common theme across the whole week is keeping an eye on alerts and support channels. If something looks recurring or noisy, we investigate it properly. The goal is not just to react, but to reduce future noise and prevent repeat issues.

## Monday

For me, Monday is usually “Maintenance Monday”, but I do it **fortnightly**. In one of my previous places, we did it **weekly**.

This is the time we focus on reducing toil and clearing tech debt. Upgrading dependencies, patching things, dealing with vulnerabilities, tidying up rough edges, and generally keeping the platform healthy. It’s not the most glamorous work, but it’s one of the most important.

Fortnightly, I also have a 1:1 with my manager on Monday. I genuinely think 1:1s are essential, not just for platform engineers but for anyone. It’s a space to talk about career progression, current challenges, how things are going, and sometimes just a normal chat.

We also have a retrospective meeting **fortnightly**. It’s our chance to look back as a team, discuss pain points, celebrate wins, and bring up any burning questions or tricky platform topics that need attention.

---

## Tuesday

Tuesday is where I usually focus on project work. Some weeks it’s deep work and building improvements. Some weeks it includes ad hoc tasks that pop up.

Fortnightly, we also have a planning meeting. This is where we go over the task board and check a few things:

- Are there any blockers?
- Does everyone have enough work and the right kind of work?
- Is there anything urgent that we need to prioritise based on business needs?

Planning sounds simple, but it saves a lot of pain later.

---

## Wednesday

Mid-week is still focused work.

We also run a weekly open door session. This is where we invite our “customers”, meaning internal developers, to drop in.

It usually helps with a few things:

- We can share what is coming up on the platform
- Developers can ask questions and clear doubts
- Teams can suggest improvements or feature requests

Sometimes a 15-minute conversation can save days of back-and-forth in a support channel.

---

## Thursday

Thursday is usually about continuing the work and trying to wrap things up before the weekend.

If something is nearly done, this is the day I try to finish it. If it’s risky or half-baked, I’d rather not rush it just to “close the week”.

This is also the day where we might do some final checks, tidy documentation, or leave things in a good place for whoever is on-call.

---

## Friday

It’s friyay.

Friday often has some kind of broader meeting, like a tech all-hands, show and tell, or a business all-hands. It’s a good way to stay connected with what’s happening outside the platform team.

If the week has been intense, Friday is also a good time to reflect a bit, write down learnings, and set the team up for a smoother next week.

---

## Saturday and Sunday

Usually, nothing happens.

But if someone is on-call for out-of-hours, weekends can include incidents, false alarms, or planned maintenance work.

On-call is a big part of platform engineering in many organisations, and it shapes the week.

In my case, I typically do:

- **In-hours on-call**: once a month, for one week (during business hours)
- **Out-of-hours on-call**: once a month, for one week (evenings and weekends)

## While on In hour support week

When I’m on-call, project work can take a backseat. My focus shifts towards support and reliability.

Internal developers reach out in a support channel, and I help them troubleshoot issues, unblock them, and guide them to the right approach. If an incident happens and the platform is involved, I join the incident channel and help resolve it.

## Final thoughts

So overall, that’s what a week in the life of a Platform Engineer can look like. Some weeks are calm and planned. Some weeks are support-heavy. Some weeks are full of maintenance and small improvements that make a big long-term difference.

How does your week look? Do you have a similar cadence, or something totally different? Let me know in the comments.
