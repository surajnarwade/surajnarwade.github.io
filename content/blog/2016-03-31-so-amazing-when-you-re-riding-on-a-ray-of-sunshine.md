I was listening to song ‘We love Raleigh’ by Brian Totty (so-called Red Hat anthem) :P.
   *‘So amazing when you’re riding on a ray of sunshine now you’re feeling like you might be einstein’*
   Almost more than one month is spent at Red hat, being surrounded by all OpenSource contributors, peoples dedicated to technologies are here. So, things are becoming cool & awesome, I got to know new things every single day !!!
   

Then I got a task to create Jenkins job using JJb for the unit test using nosetest,  pylint tests, I got stuck with one issue regarding master-slave handshake whereas Rishabh gave me only  hint EXPLORE THE SLAVE that was pretty awesome one. only one hint lead to clear all concepts around it. Thanks *Rishabh* for it.

on 1st march, *Communication guidelines* session was taken by *Kushal das*.In this session , He told us about Netiquettes and other communication guidelines while having conversation on IRC or mailing list.

I also read *"2015 Open Source Yearbook"* in free time. I  got lots of ways to use ownCloud in creative ways, awesome Open hardware projects like Raspberry projects. Also, I got to know that even facebook also OpenSourcing many of their  projects like HHVM, React, RocksDB, etc. I suggest you,  go through it.
