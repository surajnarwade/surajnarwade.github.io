A [golang hands-on workshop](https://www.meetup.com/Practical-Data-Science-Workshops-Bangalore/events/238824064/) was organized under meetup group [*Practical Data Science*](https://www.meetup.com/Practical-Data-Science-Workshops-Bangalore/) on May 6th, 2017. It was run up event for [Devconf India 2017](https://rootconf.talkfunnel.com/devconf-2017/). Around 60 people turned up. [Baiju's](https://twitter.com/nogenerics), who was workshop instructor, started with introduction of golang. 

He carried audience through the setup of golang SDK, basic golang semantics, datatypes, control structures, concurrency and other advanced constructs.

Me([SurajN](https://twitter.com/red_suraj)), [SurajD](https://twitter.com/surajd_) and [Zeeshan](https://twitter.com/zee_10000) volunteered for the event. We helped attendees for installing golang and also helped them while they were solving exercises given by Baiju.

At around 1:15pm, we broke off for lunch.

People were eager to learn golang and the workshop was very interactive.

Post lunch [Bargava](https://twitter.com/bargava) explained how golang and Data community converge and what could be the possible future of Data Science in his view.

[Baiju's](https://twitter.com/nogenerics) passion for teaching golang was immense and that inspired folks to follow along.
