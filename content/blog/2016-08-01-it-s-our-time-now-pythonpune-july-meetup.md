[Python Pune July Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/PythonPune/events/232609681/) was held at [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en), Pune on 30th July 2016, this meetup was quite different than previous meetups because talks were given by Interns.
Around 40 pythonistas were present for meetups, some were students and some were professionals.
Topics for the meetup were as below:

1. *How do I automate boring stuff using Python?* by [Suraj Narwade](https://twitter.com/red_suraj)
2. *Writing unit tests for any Python Script* by [Sudhir Verma](https://www.facebook.com/sudhirvverma)
3. *Static v/s Dynamically typed languages* by [Ganesh Kadam](https://twitter.com/meganeshkadam)
4. *Regular Expressions in Python* by [Rahul Bajaj](https://www.facebook.com/rahul.bajaj.7568596?fref=ts)
   

Meetup started with Rahul Bajaj's topic regarding Regular Expressions.

[Chandan](https://twitter.com/ciypro) extended my topic and asked pythonistas to share their ideas regarding  boring stuff in their day to day life. we collected those ideas in etherpad and will work on it soon. [Click here for etherpad](https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/boring_scripts)

As Unit Testing is known as important part of software development process, We can determine the working of code and how it will react to various inputs. It is an excellent way to detect defects and refactor the code. [Sudhir](https://www.facebook.com/sudhirvvermaa) explained unit test, its working along with simple [examples](https://github.com/sudhirverma/unittest).
